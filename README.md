# Image Analysis using Federated Learning (v1)

This repository simulates a federated learning workflow for brain tumor MRI classification across three Indian hospitals. Data remains local to each hospital dataset, and a global model is trained on aggregated knowledge. A Streamlit dashboard visualizes hospital stats and model metrics using real artifacts generated by the training notebook.

## Project v1 Summary

- Task: Brain tumor MRI classification (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, notumor).
- Datasets: 3 hospital datasets (AIIMS Delhi, NIMHANS Bengaluru, Tata Memorial Mumbai).
- Model: ResNet18 trained from scratch (no pretrained weights).
- Output: Streamlit dashboard with map, analytics, inference, and logs.
- Artifacts: Run-scoped JSON files in artifacts/run-### plus model files in models/.
- Logging: Each run writes logs to logs/<timestamp>/training.log.

## Repository Layout

- notebook.ipynb: End-to-end data audit, training, evaluation, and artifact generation.
- app.py: Streamlit dashboard reading artifacts and model files.
- dataset/: Hospital datasets (see expected structure below).
- models/: Model weights and metadata.
- artifacts/: Run-scoped training artifacts (run-001, run-002, ...).
- logs/: Time-stamped log folders (one per run).
- architecture.md: System overview.

## Expected Dataset Structure

Place the datasets under dataset/ with the following structure (case-sensitive folders are handled by normalization):

- dataset/dataset-1/
  - glioma/
  - meningioma/
  - pituitary/
  - notumor/

- dataset/dataset-2/
  - glioma/
  - meningioma/
  - pituitary tumor/

- dataset/dataset-3/Brain_Cancer raw MRI data/Brain_Cancer/
  - brain_glioma/
  - brain_menin/
  - brain_tumor/

The notebook includes a dataset audit that logs missing paths, folder names, and image counts. If no images are discovered, the run fails with a clear error.

## Local Setup (macOS / Windows / Linux)

### 1) Create and activate a virtual environment

macOS / Linux:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 2) Install dependencies

```
pip install -U pip
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install streamlit folium streamlit-folium plotly pandas scikit-learn pillow
```

Notes:

- If you have a CUDA-capable GPU, install the correct PyTorch build from https://pytorch.org.
- The project trains from scratch to avoid SSL issues when downloading weights.

### 3) Run training (notebook)

Open notebook.ipynb and run all cells in order.

Outputs:

- models/global_model.pth
- models/label_map.json
- models/model_meta.json
- artifacts/run-###/dataset_stats.json
- artifacts/run-###/dataset_splits.json
- artifacts/run-###/training_history.json
- logs/<timestamp>/training.log

### 4) Run the dashboard

```
streamlit run app.py
```

The dashboard automatically reads the latest artifacts run folder.

## Training on More Datasets

To add another hospital dataset:

1. Add a new entry in DATASETS and HOSPITAL_CONFIGS in notebook.ipynb.
2. Ensure the class folder names map to the standard labels (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, notumor).
3. Re-run the notebook to generate a new run folder.

Tips:

- If folder names do not match, the audit log will list unmatched folders.
- You can update class_map for the new dataset to align names.

## Metrics (Placeholder)

The following are placeholder metrics until the next full training run completes:

- Test Accuracy: TBD
- Macro F1: TBD
- Macro Precision: TBD
- Macro Recall: TBD

Per-class metrics will be logged and stored in models/model_meta.json after training.

## Known Constraints in v1

- Single global model (no true federated server/client exchange).
- CPU training is slow for large datasets.
- No differential privacy or encryption in v1.

## Troubleshooting

- Zero images discovered: Check dataset paths and folder names in logs/<timestamp>/training.log.
- Streamlit file watcher error: .streamlit/config.toml disables file watching.
- SSL certificate errors: ResNet18 uses weights=None to avoid downloads.
